### Game Dev Mind • Systems Thinker • Digital Experimenter

🖤 Code is my weapon.  
🧠 Systems are my playground.  
🔥 Experiments are my doctrine.

## 🧠 Player Profile

I approach development like game design:

- Mechanics first  
- Systems over hacks  
- Iteration over perfection  

I’ve explored **game dev, web dev, desktop tools**, and experimental builds—  
not to collect repos, but to **master patterns**.

Some projects shipped.  
Some were scrapped.  
All improved my stats.

## 🕹️ Things I’ve Played With (And Learned From)

- 🎮 Game prototypes (mechanics, movement, systems)
- 🧠 Logic-heavy experiments & simulations
- 🖥️ Desktop tools & utilities
- 🌐 UI systems inspired by game UX principles

Games teach discipline.  
Games expose bad architecture fast.  
That’s why I like them.

## 🏁 Multiplayer?

If you enjoy:
- Building systems from scratch
- Iterating until it *feels right*
- Treating code like design

Then yes—  
we should play co-op.
